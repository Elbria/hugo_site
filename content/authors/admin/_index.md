I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu).  I am a member of the [CLIP](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) lab advised by [Marine Carpuat](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~marine/). My research interests revolve around the NLP fields of semantics, natural language inference (NLI), multilingual NLP, and neural machine translation (NMT). I am currently focusing on detecting differences in meaning that span multiple languages. My ultimate goal is to explore how—coarse or fine-grained—cross-lingual semantic mismatches **question** common assumptions related to using data when developing NLP technology within and across languages.

Previously, I interned with [Joel Tetreault](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/academic.html) at [Dataminr](https://www.dataminr.com). Before that, I was a member of the [SLP](https://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr) lab, advised by [Alexandros Potamianos](http://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr/potam/), where I worked on the extraction of topic-based word embeddings that integrate contextual variations in word semantics. Both Greek and English versions of my thesis can be found [here](https://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/handle/123456789/47528).
