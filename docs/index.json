We study the impact of transfer learning from another low-resource but related language. We experiment with different ways of encoding lexical units to maximize lexical overlap between the two language pairs, as well as back-translation and ensembling.

In this work, we propose a DSM that learns multiple distributional representations of a word based on different topics. First, a separate DSM is trained for each topic and then each of the topic-based DSMs is aligned to a common vector space. Our unsupervised mapping approach is motivated by the hypothesis that words preserving their relative distances in different topic semantic sub-spaces constitute robust semantic anchors that define the mappings between them. Aligned cross-topic representations achieve state-of-the-art results for the task of contextual word similarity. Furthermore, evaluation on NLP downstream tasks shows that multiple topic-based embeddings outperform single-prototype models.","tags":null,"title":"Cross-Topic Distributional Semantic Representations Via Unsupervised Mappings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fenia Christopoulou","Eleftheria Briakou","Elias Iosif","Alexandros Potamianos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517529600,"objectID":"c9906bcb77e41f1cc8f1450545aa9adb","permalink":"/publication/c/","publishdate":"2018-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/c/","section":"publication","summary":"Typically, Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) estimate semantic similarity between words using a single-model, where the multiple senses of polysemous words are conflated in a single representation. Similarly, in textual affective analysis tasks, ambiguous words are usually not treated differently when estimating word affective scores. In this work, a semantic mixture model is proposed enabling the combination of word similarity scores estimated across multiple topic-specific DSMs (TDSMs). Based on the assumption that semantic similarity implies affective similarity, we extend this model to perform sentence-level affect estimation. The proposed model outperforms the baseline approach achieving state-of-the-art results for semantic similarity estimation and sentence-level polarity detection.","tags":null,"title":"Mixture of Topic-Based Distributional Semantic and Affective Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"/home/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
